# mysql_reader

A program for generating a website backend from a configuration file describing a database structure. The name of the repository is 
somewhat of a misnomer, as the code can handle the reading of a database structure defined in both SQL and JSON. In the case of reading 
JSON, SQL for defining the underlying database will be generated.
